# CF Code Challenge 13
## Multi-bracket Validation.
Check for balanced brackets in a String.

## Challenge
### Feature Tasks
On your main file, createâ€¦
    C#: a function called bool MultiBracketValidation(string input)
    JavaScript: a function called multiBracketValidation(input)
    Python: a function called multi_bracket_validation(input)
    Java: a method public static boolean multiBracketValidation(String input)

Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

    Round Brackets : ()
    Square Brackets : []
    Curly Brackets : {}
