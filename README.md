# CF Code Challenge Day 01
## Reverse an Array
This is CF 401 day one code challenge.

## Challenge
Write a method that takes in an array, and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a method that uses a descending loop to walk from the end of the input array to its
beginning. With each increment, place the element into the return array, which is incremented in
ascending order.
