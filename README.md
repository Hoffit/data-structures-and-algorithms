# Code Fellows 401 Data Structures and Algorithms
This repo will be home to daily code challenges.


# CF Code Challenge Day 01
## Reverse an Array
This is CF 401 day one code challenge.

## Challenge
Write a method that takes in an array, and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a method that uses a descending loop to walk from the end of the input array to its
beginning. With each increment, place the element into the return array, which is incremented in
ascending order.

# CF Code Challenge Day 02
## Insert Shift Array.
This is CF 401 day one code challenge.

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without
utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value
added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a method that determines the middle index at which to insert the new value. Then, it loops
through the input array and inserts the values in the output array, and when the middle index is
encountered, inserts the new value.
