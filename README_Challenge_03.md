# CF Code Challenge Day 03
## Array Binary Search.
This is CF 401 day three code challenge.

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the
arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a method that follows the wiki binary search algorithm closely:
