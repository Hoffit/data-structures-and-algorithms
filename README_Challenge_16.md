# CF Code Challenge 16
## FizzBuzz.
Conduct FizzBuzz on a tree while traversing through it; Change the value of each
of the nodes, depending on the current node.

## Challenge
### Feature Tasks
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

Return the tree with its news values.
