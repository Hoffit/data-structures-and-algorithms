# CF Code Challenge 06
## LinkedList Insertions
Prior labs had us build LinkedList with Nodes. This challenge has us expand it a bit with three new insertion methods.

## Challenge
### Feature Tasks

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

## Approach & Efficiency
See the white board images.

## Solution for method .append(value)

## Solution for method .insertBefore(value, newVal)

## Solution for method .insertAfter(value, newVal)
No white board write up. Solution is like insertBefore.
