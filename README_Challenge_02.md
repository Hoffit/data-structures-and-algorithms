## Insert Shift Array.
This is CF 401 day one code challenge.

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without
utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value
added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a method that determines the middle index at which to insert the new value. Then, it loops
through the input array and inserts the values in the output array, and when the middle index is
encountered, inserts the new value.
