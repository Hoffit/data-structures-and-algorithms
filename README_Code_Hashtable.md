# Hashtables
Implement a hashtable.

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following capabilities

a method/function named add that takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key and add the key and value pair to the table.
A method/function named Find that takes in the key and returns the value from key/value pair.
A method/function named contains that takes in the key and returns if the key exists in the table already.
A method/function named GetHash that takes in a key and returns the index in the array the key is stored.

## Approach & Efficiency
add, find, contains, getHash

Big O(n) time.
Big O(n) space.

## API
