# CF Code Challenge 31 - First repeated word
Find the first repeated word in a book.

Given a big input string of characters, find the first word that occurs twice.

## Challenge
### Feature Tasks
    Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
    Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Approach & Efficiency
Performance based on n, number of words.

- Big O(n) time (At worst, must look at every word)
- Big O(n) space (Creates a hashmap of words)
